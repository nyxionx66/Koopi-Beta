## 📱 Responsive Design Guidelines

### Breakpoint System
```css
Mobile (Default):  320px - 639px
Tablet (sm):      640px - 767px
Desktop (md):     768px - 1023px
Large (lg):       1024px - 1279px
XLarge (xl):      1280px+
```

### Mobile-First Approach
1. **Start with mobile layout** - Design smallest screen first
2. **Progressive enhancement** - Add features at larger breakpoints
3. **Touch-friendly targets** - Minimum 44px tap targets
4. **Readable text** - Minimum 14px font size on mobile
5. **Stackable components** - Flex-col by default, flex-row at breakpoints

### Common Responsive Patterns
```jsx
// Hidden on mobile, visible on desktop
<div className="hidden md:block">Desktop Only</div>

// Grid that adapts
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4">

// Responsive padding
<div className="p-4 sm:p-6 lg:p-8">

// Responsive text
<h1 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl lg:text-3xl">
```
